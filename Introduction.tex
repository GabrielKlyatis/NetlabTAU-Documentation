\chapter{Introduction}
\large In our final project for the Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we aimed to implement several network protocols in C++ and enhance the existing protocol framework.\\\\Our efforts included successfully upgrading the development environment to Visual Studio 2022, which was paired with the transition to the GoogleTest framework for our testing needs.\\We developed and tested new functionalities for IP Fragmentation, UDP, and refined the  TCP protocol - splitting it into 3 separate classes of Reno, Tahoe and base.\\\\We implemented TLSv1.2, allowing for secure communication between sockets inside the operating system of inet os. We implemented HTTP GET and POST methods to support additional features on top of L5 of the system.\\\\This project has not only tested our abilities to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting but has also equipped us with invaluable skills in network programming and software development.\\\\In addition, we hope our endeavors would allow the students planning on taking the Advanced Computer Communications Lab to get valuable hands-on experience in programming, testing, and experimenting with these newly added protocols at the lab's experiments.
