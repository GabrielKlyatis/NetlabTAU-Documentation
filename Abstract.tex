\chapter{Abstract}

\section*{Subject}
The project, titled "Renovation of Advanced Computer Communications Lab," aims to enhance the existing operating system by refining the current implementation and integrating new protocols across various system layers.

\section*{Objective}
The primary objective is to broaden the range of experiments available to students within the lab. By doing so, we intend to equip them with additional skills and provide hands-on experience in managing a comprehensive suite of network protocols. This will ultimately increase their proficiency in the field.

\section*{Product}
The product is an enhanced and expanded version of the existent operating system - inet\_os.
